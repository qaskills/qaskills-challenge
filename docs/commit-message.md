The `git commit` command in Git is used to record changes made to the repository. It creates a snapshot of the changes in the working directory and stages them for inclusion in the project's history. The `-m` option allows you to include a commit message directly from the command line.

- **git**: This is the command-line interface for Git, a distributed version control system.

- **commit**: This Git command is used to record changes to the repository.

- **-m "Initial version for QASkills Challenge"**: The `-m` option is followed by a short, descriptive message enclosed in double quotes. This message provides a concise summary of the changes made in this commit. In this specific example, the commit message is "Initial version for QASkills Challenge."

When you run `git commit -m "Initial version for QASkills Challenge"`, you are creating a new commit with the changes you've staged using `git add`. The commit message helps others (and yourself) understand the purpose or context of the changes made in this commit.

It's worth noting that creating meaningful and informative commit messages is a good practice for maintaining a clear and understandable project history.
