The `git checkout -b` command in Git is used to create a new branch and switch to it in a single step. Let's break down the command you provided:

- **git**: This is the command-line interface for Git, a distributed version control system.

- **checkout**: This Git command is used for switching branches or restoring working tree files.

- **-b**: This option is used with `git checkout` to create and switch to a new branch in one command.

- **challenge/firstNameLastName**: This is the name of the new branch you are creating. It follows the convention of naming branches with a descriptive prefix (`challenge/`) followed by the person's first name and last name.

So, when you run the command `git checkout -b challenge/firstNameLastName`, Git will create a new branch named `challenge/firstNameLastName` and immediately switch to that branch. This is a convenient way to start working on a new feature or fixing an issue on a separate branch without affecting the main development branch (usually `master` or `main`).
